### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time for City Bank (fictional) customer’s dataset at different locations in the U.S. By analyzing various aspects of this dataset, we seek to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance towards creating  a comprehensive Bank Loan Report and gain a deeper understanding of the bank's lending performance.

### Data Sources

City Bank Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data.xlsl" file, containing detailed information needed for this analysis about borrowers from City Bank. 

### Tools

- Excel 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and Inspection.
2. Handling of missing values.
3. Data cleaning, and formatting.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis

 The EDA involved exploring the City Bank data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the Total Loan Applications
- What is the Total funded amount: Total Amount of funds disbursed as loans
- What is the Total Amount Received – Total repayment by borrowers
- What is the Average Interest rate 
- What is the Average Debt to debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- What are the Good and Bad Loans Application Percentage
- What are the Good and Bad Loans Application? This is to know the total amount of loans falling under each good or bad loan category.
- What are the Good and Bad Loans funded - to determine the total amount of money disbursed as a “Good” or “Bad” loan. 
- What is the Good or Bad Loan Total Received Amount

### Trend Data Analysis

The Trend analysis involves exploring the City Bank data for Loan Metrics and Trends, such as: 
- The Monthly Trends by Issue Date
- The Regional Analysis by State
- The Loan Term Analysis
- The Employee Length Analysis
- The Loan Purpose breakdown

### Data Analysis 

 - Power Pivot for data transformation, cleaning, and formatting.
 - EXCEL - IF function to calculate the "Good Loan" or "Bad Loan" 
 - PIVOT TABLE - To calculate the necessary KPI needed for visualization
 - PIVOT CHART - To create different charts needed to gain required insights and create
 - EXCEL - To create interactive dashboards for visualization.


### Result and Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. A total of 38.6k loan applications were received by City Bank.
2. The bank disbursed a sum of $435.8M as loans and received a total sum of $473.1M as loan repayment.
3. The average interest rate over the period in question is 12.05% with the Debt -To- Income ratio being 13.33%
4. 33.2k loan applicants which is 86.18% of the borrowers, got a total loan of $370.2M. They have either paid back their loans or are currently servicing them. A total sum of $435.8M has been paid back and written as "Good Loans"
5. While 5.3k applicants which is 13.82% of borrowers who got a total loan sum of $65.5M have been charged off and written as "Bad Loans"
6. The borrowing trend increased from January, peaking in December with 4314 applicants. January has the least month per applicant with a total of 2332 applications.
7. To seek a loan, Debt consolidation has the highest number of applications with 18.2k applications, while renewable energy has the least with 0.1k applications.

### Recommendations 

Based on the analysis done, I will recommend the following actions
- The bank can work in conjunction with renewable energy companies and create "special interest" products around January to entice borrowers to take loans for the products.
- The Bank can incentivize timely loan payments to encourage more defaulters to service their loans as, and when due.
- A very small percentage took loans for vacation purposes. The bank can create a marketing campaign about work-life balance and offer a special vacation package to attract families to go on vacations.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target different categories of customers with loan packages that will be beneficial to them.
